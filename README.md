# AxonONNX

Easily convert models between ONNX and Axon.

When loading models, this project only supports a subset of the ONNX specification. See [Ortex](https://github.com/elixir-nx/ortex) which provides full-blown compatibility for running ONNX models via ONNX Runtime bindings.

## Installation

Add to your mix.exs:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:axon_onnx, "~> 0.4"}
  ]
end
```

### Protobuf

Additionally, AxonONNX uses [protox](https://github.com/ahamez/protox) to generate code for
parsing protocol buffers data within ONNX.

If you want to regenerate this code, you can invoke the following command:

```sh
mix generate_protobuf
```

Note that you'll need to install `protoc` (>= 3.0). It must available in `$PATH`. You can download it
[here](https://github.com/google/protobuf) or you can install it with your favorite package manager
(`brew install protobuf`, `apt install protobuf-compiler`, etc.).

## Development & Test

The `onnx` python package is required to run the unit tests: `pip3 install onnx`. The test cases
will be generated automatically upon first `mix test`.
