# AxonONNX

Easily convert models between ONNX and Axon.

## Installation

AxonONNX is currently in development. You can use it as a `git` dependency:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:axon_onnx, github: "elixir-nx/axon_onnx"}
  ]
end
```

### Protobuf

Additionally, AxonONNX uses [protox](https://github.com/ahamez/protox) to generate code for parsing protocol buffers data within ONNX.

If you want to regenerate this code, you can invoke the following command:

```sh
mix generate_protobuf
```

Note that you'll need to install `protoc` (>= 3.0). It must available in `$PATH`. You can download it [here](https://github.com/google/protobuf) or you can install it with your favorite package manager (`brew install protobuf`, `apt install protobuf-compiler`, etc.).


## Development & Test
Axxon_onnx requires an Elixir runtime.
The `oxxx` python package is required to run the unit tests: `pip3 install onnx`. The test cases will be generated automatically upon first `mix test`.
